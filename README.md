# PONG

This is another clone of the well-known Atari Pong from the 70's.
I created it with a focus on having a neat, classic and minimalist design
which can look cool even on a TV screen. It's pure JavaScript and HTML5 
with the heavy use of ES6 class syntax.

Currently it's deployed on a Heroku server.

In the future I plan to add more features, like gameplay settings, online multiplayer
and a bit more interesting gameplay mechanics.
